# OctoScript App Design Flow

English | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

The development harness for [OctoSense](https://github.com/OctoSense-org) apps.
It takes you, or a coding agent, from an idea (a text brief, a generated UX
image) to a contained app bundle that passes the
[OctoSense App Hub](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense-App-Hub) gate
and is ready for a person to sign and submit.

It holds the rules for agents ([AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)), step-by-step design
flows ([flows/](flows/README.md)), the developer docs ([docs/](docs/)), a
runnable app template ([templates/script-app](templates/script-app/README.md)),
worked examples ([examples/](examples/README.md)) and `tools/octo`, a small CLI
over the App Hub's real `card-host` and `hub` binaries. It never decides
admission itself: `tools/octo check` prints exactly what `hub check` prints.

Who it is for: hackathon contestants and other developers building an
OctoSense app, and the coding agents they work with.

Formerly *Octoscript-AppCard*. The runtime moved to
[OctoSense-AppCard](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense-AppCard) and
the first-party apps to
[OctoSense-System-Apps](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense-System-Apps).

## Agents start here

Read these in order (the same order the
[OctoSense org profile](https://github.com/OctoSense-org) gives):

1. [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md): the rules, the definition of done, and every point
   where you stop and ask a person.
2. [flows/README.md](flows/README.md): pick the flow for what you start from,
   then follow that flow's `FLOW.md` step by step.
3. [docs/QUICKSTART.md](docs/QUICKSTART.md) and
   [docs/SCRIPT-API.md](docs/SCRIPT-API.md): build and run the app with
   `tools/octo`; use only documented APIs (or ones you can cite from the
   runtime source or a System App).
4. [docs/PUBLISHING.md](docs/PUBLISHING.md), with the App Hub's
   [publishing contract](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense-App-Hub/blob/main/docs/PUBLISHING.md):
   stamp, screenshot, check, sign and submit.

The human checkpoints (publisher keys and signing, publisher identity and
privacy text, platform claims, paid image generation, visual approval,
submission) are listed in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) and
[flows/README.md](flows/README.md#every-flow-follows-the-same-contract). An
agent never fabricates an approval, a review result or a submission.

## Status

Script apps depend on work that is not on every `main` branch yet. Read this
before you build.

| Piece | State |
| --- | --- |
| Script-app gate, scan and `os.` id check in `hub` | Open PR [OctoSense-App-Hub#4](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense-App-Hub/pull/4) (`apps/script-and-system-apps`). The docs here were verified against its commit `79a2c4f`. |
| Contained script apps and host services in the runtime | Open PR [OctoSense-org/makepad#30](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/makepad/pull/30) (`sandbox/contained-tier-gates`), verified at `d94e5e6`. |
| System and store apps in OctoSense-Desktop | Open PR [OctoSense-Desktop#36](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense-Desktop/pull/36). |
| Submission route | An issue on OctoSense-App-Hub (below). That route is written in App Hub PR #4; App Hub `main` still describes a planned index-repository pull request and release action that do not exist yet. |
| Installing your own bundle on a phone | Not supported. See [Running an app](#running-an-app). |

[docs/QUICKSTART.md §1](docs/QUICKSTART.md#1-prerequisites) lists the exact
revisions that were verified together. Once those PRs merge, use `main`.

## Quick path

Prerequisites ([QUICKSTART §1](docs/QUICKSTART.md#1-prerequisites)):

- Rust (stable, via rustup), with `~/.cargo/bin` on `PATH`.
- Python 3.9 or newer (no packages needed for `tools/octo`).
- A graphical session: `card-host` opens a real 412x892-point window, even
  when an agent drives it.
- One workspace directory holding this repository and its siblings, because
  the App Hub's `Cargo.toml` patches Makepad and Octoscript to those paths:

  ```text
  <workspace>/
    OctoScript-App-Design-Flow/   this repository
    OctoSense-App-Hub/            hub, card-host, appstore
    makepad/                      OctoSense-org/makepad
    octoscript-makepad/           OctoSense-org/Octoscript-Makepad
    octoscript/                   OctoSense-org/Octoscript
  ```

Then, from this repository:

```sh
# 1. Build the two tools once (in the App Hub checkout)
(cd ../OctoSense-App-Hub && cargo build --release -p octosense-card-host -p octosense-app-hub)
tools/octo doctor                                        # finds hub and card-host; prints fixes if not

# 2. Create an app from the template
tools/octo new ~/apps/my-app --id my-notes --name "My Notes"

# 3. Run it in a real window with the remote-control bridge
tools/octo run ~/apps/my-app/bundle --port 8141 --detach
curl -s "127.0.0.1:8141/snap?q=Notes"                    # what is on screen

# 4. Iterate: edit bundle/main.splash, then quit and run again
curl -s 127.0.0.1:8141/quit
tools/octo run ~/apps/my-app/bundle --port 8141 --detach

# 5. Capture a real screenshot, then check against the App Hub gate
tools/octo shot 8141 ~/apps/my-app/bundle/screenshots/01-main.png
curl -s 127.0.0.1:8141/quit
tools/octo check ~/apps/my-app/bundle                    # hub stamp + hub check

# 6. Publish: print the checklist and follow docs/PUBLISHING.md
tools/octo package-help
```

What to expect:

- `new` prints `created …` and `bundle stamped`.
- `run --detach` returns once `card-host` logs
  `card-host: my-notes 0.1.0 admitted — capabilities {"storage"}, …`. Script
  errors appear in `<app>/.local-state/card-host.log` after `[SPLASH] eval:`.
- `check` on a fresh copy of the template is **refused** on purpose:
  `[refused] listing: screenshots/01-main.png is named by the listing but is not in the bundle`.
  It passes (`my-notes 0.1.0 — PASSED` plus the unsigned warning) once a real
  capture exists. Never add a dummy image. `check` also notes the template's
  placeholder publisher text in `listing.json`, which a person must replace.

The full walk-through, with verified output for every step, is
[docs/QUICKSTART.md](docs/QUICKSTART.md).

## `tools/octo`

Python 3.9+, no third-party packages. Run `tools/octo <command> -h` for flags.

| Command | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `doctor` | Checks Python, finds `hub` and `card-host` (rejecting GitHub's unrelated `hub` CLI), checks the template, and prints how to fix what is missing. |
| `new <dir> [--id ID] [--name NAME] [--system]` | Copies `templates/script-app` (`bundle/`, `AGENTS.md`, `.gitignore`), sets id, name and version `0.1.0`, and stamps the bundle. Ids are `[a-z0-9.-]{1,64}`; `os.*` needs `--system`. |
| `run <bundle> [--port N] [--detach] [--system] [--no-stamp] [--app-data DIR] [--static PREFIX=DIR]` | Runs `card-host --bundle … --app-data … --allow-unsigned --stamp` with `MAKEPAD_REMOTE=<port>` (default 8141). The app's jail is `<app>/.local-state/<id>/`. |
| `shot <port> <out.png>` | Saves a PNG of the running window (`GET /g?raw=1`). |
| `check <bundle> [hub check flags]` | `hub stamp`, then `hub check --allow-unsigned`; exits nonzero on a refusal. Does not restamp a signed manifest. |
| `package-help` | Prints the publish checklist. |

Binaries are found in `$OCTO_HUB` / `$OCTO_CARD_HOST`, then
`$OCTOSENSE_APP_HUB/target/release`, `$CARGO_TARGET_DIR/release`,
`$OCTOSENSE_APP_HUB/../target/release`, `../OctoSense-App-Hub/target/release`,
`../target/release`, then `PATH`.

## Design flows

A flow turns one kind of input into something OctoSense can run. Each
`FLOW.md` has a prerequisite check, then numbered steps, each with a command
and a pass condition, and marks the human checkpoints.

| Flow | You start from | You get | Step list |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| script-app | A text brief: what the app does, its screens, data, states and hosts | A contained script app bundle (`manifest.json`, `listing.json`, `main.splash`, `assets/`, real screenshots) that passes the gate | [flows/script-app/FLOW.md](flows/script-app/FLOW.md) |
| image-to-card | A generated UX image: one atlas of 8–12 screens of a service journey, or a single screen | Native L0 cards (`page.card`, `page.data.json`, `kit/`), extracted service cards, a card bundle, optionally WASM | [flows/image-to-card/FLOW.md](flows/image-to-card/FLOW.md) |
| kits/sketch | A licensed Sketch design kit | A **theme kit** (native L0 components and themes), not an app; the other flows consume it | [flows/kits/sketch/FLOW.md](flows/kits/sketch/FLOW.md) |

For a text brief, use script-app: it is the one path `tools/octo` automates
end to end. The image and Sketch flows need macOS, Python 3.12, their own
virtual environments and, for native capture, Makepad Studio; each FLOW.md
lists its prerequisites. Every app flow ends in the same hand-off (stamp,
check, run in `card-host`, screenshot, sign, submit), described in
[flows/README.md](flows/README.md#every-flow-follows-the-same-contract).

## What an app is

An OctoSense app is a small, contained bundle. Only `bundle/` is submitted;
everything else in the app's repository stays out of it.

```text
my-app/                     the app's own git repository
  AGENTS.md  .gitignore     copied by tools/octo new; not submitted
  BRIEF.md  build/          your brief, hub scan's review packet; not submitted
  .local-state/             card-host's jail and log; not submitted
  bundle/                   THE SUBMISSION
    manifest.json           id, name, version, capabilities, hosts, integrity
    listing.json            what the store shows
    main.splash             the program (a card app has page.card + kit/ instead)
    assets/icon.svg         the icon the listing names
    screenshots/01-main.png real captures, 1 to 8, named by the listing
```

**`manifest.json`**: `schema`, `id`, `name`, `version` (new for every
release), `capabilities` (the permissions it asks for), `network.hosts`
(bare host names, with `net`), and `integrity.bundle_blake3`, written by
`hub stamp` (plus a signature after `hub sign-manifest`). Optional requests
(`storage.max_bytes`, `compute.*`, `agent`) are clamped to the host's
ceilings; `hub check` prints the resulting `grants:` line.

**Capabilities** form a closed list defined by the App Hub: `storage`, `net`,
`images`, `web`, `camera`, `microphone`, `library`, `location`, `mail`,
`prompt`, `ledger.read`, `clipboard`. Not requested means not granted, and the
store shows the person one plain-language line per capability before install.
Ask for the least the app needs. What each unlocks and which have no working
path yet (`prompt`, `ledger.read`, `clipboard`):
[docs/CAPABILITIES.md](docs/CAPABILITIES.md).

**`listing.json`**: subtitle, description, category, keywords, icon,
screenshots, the platforms you actually tested, age rating and the publisher
(name, support, https privacy-policy URL). Valid values:
[docs/PUBLISHING.md §3.2](docs/PUBLISHING.md#32-finalize-the-listing).

**`main.splash`**: the program, in Splash (OctoScript), interpreted with no
compile step. Top-level `let` state and `fn`s, then one root widget; start
work with `start_timeout(0.05, || boot())`, since `ui` is injected after the
body runs. `{{assets}}` in the source is replaced by the loopback origin that
serves the bundle (`http_resource("{{assets}}/thumbs/a.jpg")`). Everything an
app may call, and the gotchas that cost the most time:
[docs/SCRIPT-API.md](docs/SCRIPT-API.md).

## Containment rules

Each app runs in its own isolate under exactly the grants its manifest asks
for. The gate (`hub check`, the same code the hub runs) enforces most of this;
[docs/PUBLISHING.md §2](docs/PUBLISHING.md#2-the-rules-the-gate-enforces)
lists every check.

- **No secrets in apps.** No password, PIN or one-time-code field, no login
  form, no API key or token in the bundle. The gate refuses
  `is_password: true` and password or one-time-code content types, and the
  runtime makes such a field inert. Sign-in happens on a host-owned **sheet**.
- **Declare every host.** A `.splash` file may reach only `https://` hosts
  listed in `network.hosts` (unless the app is granted `images` or `web`).
  `http://`, `file://` and `../` are refused.
- **Only bundle files.** Allowed extensions are
  `.card .json .l0 .octoscript .splash .svg .png .jpg .jpeg .webp .ttf .otf .txt .md`;
  no scripts, archives, binaries or symlinks; 8 MB at most.
- **Host services for anything privileged.** An app calls
  `host.request("<family>.<method>", args, fn(r){…})`, and the family must be
  a granted capability. Mail is the worked example (`mail.accounts`,
  `mail.add_account`, `mail.list`, `mail.send`, …): the service raises its own
  sheet for the password and keeps it in the platform's secret store, outside
  every app's jail. `<family>.sheet.*` methods are accepted only from the
  sheet. A new service is a shell change, not a bundle:
  [docs/HOST-SERVICES.md](docs/HOST-SERVICES.md).
- **Store apps and system apps.** Ids under `os.` are reserved for system
  apps: the gate refuses them and no store installs one. System apps (News,
  Photos, Maps, Camera, Mail in
  [OctoSense-System-Apps](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense-System-Apps))
  have the same bundle shape, ship with the shells and get higher ceilings
  (for example 64 MiB storage instead of 16 MiB). `tools/octo new --system`
  and `tools/octo run --system` exist for developing them. Everything else is
  a store app, distributed only through the signed App Hub catalog.

## Running an app

**Standalone, in `card-host`** (the development loop). `card-host` is App
Hub's reference contained host for one bundle. `tools/octo run` starts it with
Makepad's remote-control bridge on a local port, so a person or an agent can
drive the real window over HTTP (all GET, window points, y down):

| Route | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `/snap` (`?q=` filters) | Widgets with rects and text |
| `/d` | The whole widget tree as text |
| `/click?x=&y=&wait=1` | A real click |
| `/t?t=TEXT&wait=1` | Types into the focused input |
| `/k?k=down&c=ReturnKey` | A key event |
| `/log?n=50` | The last log lines |
| `/g?raw=1` | A PNG of the window (what `tools/octo shot` saves) |
| `/quit` (or `/gq`) | Quits; always end with this |

Rows built by `on_render` do not always appear in `/snap`; confirm them with a
screenshot or the jail file. `card-host` registers **no** host services, so a
Mail-style app gets `no service answers "mail" on this device` there. The
current `card-host` also refuses signed manifests: take screenshots before
signing.

**In the shells.** OctoSense-Desktop and OctoSense ROM's Home run apps with
App Hub's Card runner (the `card` module in App Hub's `crates/appstore`), not
with `card-host` itself; it applies the same manifest policy. System apps are
packed into the shell build from OctoSense-System-Apps; store apps are
installed from the App Hub store out of the signed catalog. The Desktop side
of this is in open PR
[OctoSense-Desktop#36](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense-Desktop/pull/36).

**On a phone, today** ([QUICKSTART §9](docs/QUICKSTART.md#9-run-it-on-an-octosense-phone)):

- An arbitrary bundle cannot be side-loaded onto a stock OctoSense phone. The
  phone's store reads the built-in hub and trusts only the anchor compiled
  into the build; the `OCTOSENSE_HUB` / `OCTOSENSE_HUB_ANCHOR` overrides are
  environment variables the Android launcher does not set. Installing from a
  local catalog on a device is unsupported and unverified.
- The closest verified path is on the desktop: publish into a local catalog
  with a throwaway anchor and install it with App Hub's standalone `appstore`
  ([PUBLISHING §4](docs/PUBLISHING.md#4-rehearse-the-store-path-locally)).
  Opening the installed app from that standalone store was not shown to work.
- `card-host`'s remote bridge is compiled out on Android; phone testing goes
  through the shell's own instrument, not `tools/octo`.
- After publication, the app appears in every phone's store from the signed
  catalog.

## Publishing

[docs/PUBLISHING.md](docs/PUBLISHING.md) is the step-by-step path;
`tools/octo package-help` prints its checklist. The contract itself belongs to
the App Hub ([its PUBLISHING.md](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense-App-Hub/blob/main/docs/PUBLISHING.md)).
In short:

1. Finalize `manifest.json` (new version, minimal capabilities, every host)
   and `listing.json` (no placeholders; the publisher fields are the
   publisher's to write).
2. Capture real screenshots with `tools/octo shot` and look at each one.
3. `tools/octo check <bundle>` until it prints `— PASSED` with only the
   unsigned warning. Optionally add `--catalog <App Hub catalog.json>` to catch
   a reused version or a publisher-key change.
4. `hub scan <bundle> --packet build/review.json` and answer its seven
   reviewer questions in writing.
5. **HUMAN:** `hub keygen` (once, outside every repository),
   `hub sign-manifest <bundle> --key … --key-id <publisher-id>`, then
   `hub check <bundle> --publisher-key <id>=<hex>`. Any edit after signing
   needs stamp and sign again.
6. **HUMAN:** tag the commit in the app's public repository and open an issue
   titled `Submit <app id> <version>` on
   [OctoSense-App-Hub](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense-App-Hub/issues)
   with the repository, tag, commit, bundle path, publisher key, `hub check`
   output and the scan answers.

A maintainer re-runs the gate and the scan on the exact bytes and runs
`hub publish`, which copies the bundle into the hub and signs a new catalog.

Limits, stated plainly:

- The issue route is the one written in App Hub PR #4 (see [Status](#status));
  App Hub `main` still describes an index-repository pull request and an
  `octosense-org/publish-app` action that do not exist. Re-read App Hub's
  "Submitting" section before you submit.
- Never open a pull request that edits the App Hub's `catalog.json`, `index/`
  or `artifacts/`: only `hub publish` with the hub's key writes them.
- A first submission always waits for a person. Automatic merging for
  returning publishers is planned, not built.
- The gate does not judge screenshots, listing text or the privacy policy; a
  reviewer does.

## Examples

Reference journeys built with the image-to-card flow. Each owns its design
source, reviewed card scenes, service code and tests.

| Example | Surfaces | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Aircon](examples/aircon/README.md) | Native cards / WASM | A purchase-to-installation journey: 12 screen states, 14 service-card variants |
| [School](examples/school/README.md) | Native cards / WASM | School notice, calendar and payment |
| [Health](examples/health/README.md) | Native cards / WASM | A fictional health-check booking |
| [Reunion](examples/reunion/README.md) | Native cards / WASM | Reunion planning, RSVP and payment |
| [Calendar](examples/calendar/README.md) | Native cards / browser preview + sync server | One calendar on two devices, with a SQLite-backed sync server |

For a script app, the complete examples are the first-party bundles in
[OctoSense-System-Apps](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense-System-Apps)
(`apps/<name>/bundle/`), plus [templates/script-app](templates/script-app/README.md).

## Contributing

- Branch from `main` and open a pull request; CI must pass.
- CI runs `python tools/check-links.py` (relative links in tracked Markdown
  must resolve) and, on macOS, prepares the native runtime with
  `tools/setup-native.py` and runs the flow, core, Sketch and maintenance
  unit tests (see [.github/workflows/ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml)).
- Keep the docs honest: every command in them was run, and anything not run
  is marked **unverified**. When the runtime or `hub` disagrees with a doc,
  fix the doc or report the gap with a reproduction.
- Changes to the runtime, the gate, the shells or the system apps belong in
  their own repositories (below), not here.
- Do not commit purchased design assets, keys, `.local-state/` or local logs.
