# Instructions for coding agents

> **Any coding agent, or none.** These instructions work the same for Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot or a person at a terminal: every step is a shell command or a file edit, and nothing here needs a particular agent, model or vendor. `AGENTS.md` is the one source of truth; `CLAUDE.md` and `GEMINI.md` only import it for agents that look for those names.

You are in **OctoScript App Design Flow**: the harness for building an
OctoSense app and taking it to the OctoSense App Hub. Read this file first,
then the one flow you are following.

## What this repository is, and is not

| It is | It is not (go there instead) |
| --- | --- |
| Flows (`flows/*/FLOW.md`): step-by-step procedures from an input to a checked bundle | The runtime: [OctoSense-org/makepad](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/makepad) (Splash isolate, widgets) and [OctoSense-App-Hub](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense-App-Hub) (the Card runner); the AppCard assistant and the L0 card language: [OctoSense-System-Apps `apps/appcard`](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense-System-Apps/tree/main/apps/appcard) |
| Developer docs (`docs/`): quickstart, script API, capabilities, host services, publishing, glossary | System apps (News, Photos, Maps, Camera, Mail): [OctoSense-System-Apps](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense-System-Apps) |
| `tools/octo`: doctor, new, run, shot, check around the real `card-host` and `hub` | The store, gate, catalog, `hub` and `card-host` source: [OctoSense-App-Hub](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense-App-Hub) |
| Templates (`templates/script-app/`) and worked examples (`examples/`) | The shells that run apps: OctoSense ROM `home/` (phone launcher) and the OctoSense desktop shell |

If a task needs a change in one of those repositories, say so and stop; do not
patch around it here.

## How to work

1. Run `tools/octo doctor`. Fix what it reports before anything else.
   `tools/octo` is this repository's own Python CLI around App Hub's `hub` and `card-host`. It is unrelated to octos (the agent kernel inside OctoSense) and needs no AI service or API key. `doctor` checks Python, cargo, the App Hub checkout and the `hub` / `card-host` binaries.
2. Pick the flow from [flows/README.md](flows/README.md). For a text brief it
   is [flows/script-app/FLOW.md](flows/script-app/FLOW.md). Publishing is
   [docs/PUBLISHING.md](docs/PUBLISHING.md) for every flow.
3. Follow the flow's steps **in order and exactly**. Each step has a pass
   condition; do not start the next step until it holds.
4. **Stop at every human checkpoint** (marked **HUMAN** or "Human?" = yes):
   publisher keys, publisher identity and privacy text, platform claims,
   submission, approval. Report and wait. Never fabricate an approval, a
   review result, a submission or a person's answer.
5. **Never invent an API.** Use only what [docs/SCRIPT-API.md](docs/SCRIPT-API.md)
   documents, or what you found in the runtime source (makepad
   `widgets/src/splash*.rs`, `platform/script/src/`) or a working System App
   (`apps/*/bundle/main.splash`) and can cite. If neither has it, the app
   cannot use it: say so.

## Rules for every app

- **No secrets in apps.** No password, PIN or one-time-code field, no login
  form, no API key or token in the bundle. Accounts go through a host service's
  sheet ([docs/HOST-SERVICES.md](docs/HOST-SERVICES.md)).
- **Declare every host.** Every `https://` host in `main.splash` is in
  `network.hosts` (with `net`), unless the app legitimately needs `images` or
  `web`. Never `http://`.
- **Only needed capabilities.** Each capability maps to something a screen
  does ([docs/CAPABILITIES.md](docs/CAPABILITIES.md)). Remove what is unused.
- **No dummy screenshots.** Screenshots are captures of the real app in a real
  state (`tools/octo shot`), opened and looked at. Never draw, generate, crop
  from another app, or copy one to make the gate pass.
- **Restamp after every edit.** `tools/octo check` and `tools/octo run` stamp
  for you; after signing, any edit needs stamp and sign again (human).
- **Keep the bundle clean.** Only `manifest.json`, `listing.json`, the entry,
  artwork and screenshots go in `bundle/`. Notes, keys, logs, review packets
  and `.local-state/` stay out.
- **Clean up what you launch.** End every `card-host` you start with
  `curl -s 127.0.0.1:<port>/quit` (or `/gq`); do not `pkill` other windows.

## Definition of done (before hand-off to a human)

All of:

1. `tools/octo check <bundle>` prints `— PASSED` with only the unsigned warning.
2. Real screenshots in `bundle/screenshots/`, named in `listing.json`, each looked at.
3. Every interaction in the brief was driven natively in `card-host` (click,
   type, tap through the remote bridge) and its effect observed.
4. Empty, error and restart states were exercised.
5. `hub scan` packet written outside the bundle and its seven questions answered.
6. The [PUBLISHING checklist](docs/PUBLISHING.md#6-checklist-copy-then-run-top-to-bottom)
   is complete up to the first **HUMAN** line.

## Reporting

End with a report a person can check without rerunning anything:

- **Verified**: each command you ran and its result, quoted (gate output
  verbatim), with the screenshots' paths.
- **Not verified**: anything you did not run (a platform, a host service that
  `card-host` does not provide, a phone), stated as not verified, never as
  "should work".
- **Waiting on a human**: the checkpoints reached, and exactly what the person
  must do next.
- **Gaps found**: runtime or tool behavior that contradicted the docs, with the
  smallest reproduction you have.

## Syntax reminders for `main.splash`

`#x` for hex colors containing `e` (`#x1e1e2e`); `for i in n`, no `range()`;
`name := Widget{}` to address a widget as `ui.name`; `draw_bg +: {…}` merges;
separate `if` and `for` in `on_render` (no `else for`). The full list is in
[docs/SCRIPT-API.md](docs/SCRIPT-API.md#gotchas).
