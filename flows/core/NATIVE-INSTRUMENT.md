# Native App Card testing with Makepad's built-in instrument

Use the app's built-in HTTP instrument for new native UI inspection and interaction tests. Build a release executable and launch it directly with `--remote`. Automated tests can hide its native window with `MAKEPAD_HIDE_WINDOWS=1`. Studio, RunItem, and the Studio bridge are not required for this workflow.

This is the default native testing workflow for image-to-appcard projects. The image intake, semantic mapping, L0 compilation, service reducer, bundle, and visual-review requirements remain in place. Older Studio capture commands have a compatibility boundary described below; documenting the direct instrument does not change their implementation.

## Build and launch an owned instance

Follow Makepad's agent runbook (`AGENTS.md`) and app remote reference (`docs/agents/app-remote.md`) in the `makepad` checkout that `python3 tools/setup-native.py` prepares beside this repository (`$OCTOSENSE_WORKSPACE/makepad`). Read the running binary's `GET /` response for its actual protocol. Use a fresh release build after runtime changes, and record the source revisions and local adapter patches.

From this repository's root, for the existing `beauty-host` L0 adapter:

```sh
APP_PIPELINE_ROOT="$PWD"
APP_NATIVE_REQUEST="/absolute/path/to/app/runtime/current-request.json"
APP_NATIVE_LOG="$(mktemp -t appcard-native)"
cd "$OCTOSENSE_WORKSPACE/octoscript-makepad"
RUSTFLAGS='' CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_LTO=false cargo build --release -p kit-host --bin beauty-host
MAKEPAD_HIDE_WINDOWS=1 BEAUTY_REQUEST="$APP_NATIVE_REQUEST" \
  ./target/release/beauty-host --remote > "$APP_NATIVE_LOG" 2>&1 &
APP_NATIVE_PID=$!
```

The request file must already be authored by the app/controller. It identifies the compiled `.card`, data JSON, kit directory, dimensions, unique request `nonce`, output paths for native/layout/action evidence, and a unique launch identity. The current host also accepts that standalone identity in its historical `build_id` field; it is not a Studio build ID. Mount one request at a time. Do not let two controllers share a request or action file.

Run the executable from its owning workspace so resources resolve correctly. Start a loopback artwork server only when compiled assets require one. Set the app's own credential/configuration path separately; never place credentials in the request or launch arguments.

The startup log contains the instrument endpoint and owned process:

```text
[makepad-remote] listening on 127.0.0.1:PORT pid=PID app=beauty-host grabs=...
```

Retain that PID and endpoint. Do not discover or take over an unrelated running app. For a visible handoff, omit `MAKEPAD_HIDE_WINDOWS`; do not activate the window unless the user asks.

**Headless here means a hidden native window.** The tested macOS route retains Metal, native controls, and platform WebViews. It still needs a native macOS session. It does not claim that the separate `cfg(headless)` software renderer, a display-free Linux runner, iOS, or WebAssembly has been verified.

## Inspect and inject real input

Set `APP_NATIVE_ENDPOINT` to the endpoint printed by that launch:

```sh
curl --fail --silent --show-error "$APP_NATIVE_ENDPOINT/"
curl --fail --silent --show-error "$APP_NATIVE_ENDPOINT/s"
curl --fail --silent --show-error --get "$APP_NATIVE_ENDPOINT/snap" \
  --data-urlencode 'q=TextInput' --data 'all=1'
```

`/snap` returns `s` entries with native widget ID `i`, type `ty`, window `w`, and rectangle `r: [x,y,width,height]`; text/value fields include `t` and `val`. Resolve source IDs through the compiled `mapping.json`, then select the exact native ID. A substring query may also match descendants. `all=1` includes otherwise omitted widgets; it does not prove they are visible or clickable.

**Rectangles are window-local logical points.** Do not add the OS window position or multiply by DPI. Fetch fresh bounds after a mount, scroll, or resize. Click within the current visible rectangle:

```sh
# X and Y come from the latest native /snap rectangle.
curl --fail --silent --show-error --get "$APP_NATIVE_ENDPOINT/click" \
  --data "x=$APP_CLICK_X" --data "y=$APP_CLICK_Y" --data 'wait=1'
curl --fail --silent --show-error --get "$APP_NATIVE_ENDPOINT/k" \
  --data 'k=press' --data 'c=KeyA' --data 'cmd=1' --data 'wait=1'
curl --fail --silent --show-error --get "$APP_NATIVE_ENDPOINT/t" \
  --data-urlencode 't=pop.example.com' --data 'wait=1'
curl --fail --silent --show-error --get "$APP_NATIVE_ENDPOINT/m" \
  --data 'k=scroll' --data 'x=200' --data 'y=450' --data 'dy=600' --data 'wait=1'
```

`wait=1` waits for the resulting native frame. Also wait for the app's controller/reducer and request nonce to settle before asserting an asynchronous change. Acceptance tests must observe real native actions and resulting state; directly calling a reducer is a unit test, not an input test. Cover disabled controls, validation, retry, stale responses, selection/focus across redraws, and scroll restoration where relevant.

Use `/d` for the native tree and `/log?n=50` for app logs. Assert geometry and clipping from the host's measured layout where `/snap` reports only the clipped rectangle. Do not substitute rendered text or an entire screenshot for a native control.

## Capture, provenance, and cleanup

Use `/g` to capture the app's own drawable. It returns a `png` path; `/g?raw=1` returns PNG bytes. A screenshot is evidence for visual inspection, not automatic visual approval. Platform overlays such as WKWebView may require the app's existing WebKit inspection/snapshot hook; do not claim a Metal capture includes them. Never use an OS/window/display screenshot as a fallback.

Record at least:

- Native executable and relevant source/artifact hashes, launch identity, PID, hidden/visible mode, and request nonce.
- The instrument protocol response, native snapshots/tree, observed action/result evidence, and app-owned captures needed by the change.
- Fixture versus real-service checks, passed/failed assertions, and unrun visual, browser, or platform checks.
- Cleanup result for each temporary test process.

Keep personal mail, credentials, and real-account captures under private ignored storage. Publish fictional fixtures and counts-only live-service receipts. A masked TextInput can still expose its underlying value through inspection or action logging. Use a secure platform credential dialog with a private controller pipe, or an explicitly protected credential channel; do not type real passwords through `/t`, put them in URLs, or copy them into card data, snapshots, prompts, or logs.

Finish every temporary test instance with:

```sh
curl --fail --silent --show-error "$APP_NATIVE_ENDPOINT/gq"
wait "$APP_NATIVE_PID"
```

`/gq` returns `png` as an **array of paths** and `quit: 1`; `/g` returns one path. Copy any required evidence and confirm the process exited. If capture is unavailable, use `/quit`. If `/gq` already closed the process, a failed second request is not a reason to relaunch. Preserve an instance only when handing the app to the user as requested. A human-closed window is not a crash to auto-restart.

## Working examples

- [`flows/image-to-card/compare_screens.py`](../image-to-card/compare_screens.py)
  launches one fresh `beauty-host --remote` per compiled scene, grabs `/g`,
  probes every text widget's `/snap` rectangle for ink and writes side-by-side
  evidence. Its rules are in [VISUAL-CHECKS.md](../image-to-card/VISUAL-CHECKS.md).
  Example: `python3 flows/image-to-card/compare_screens.py --project examples/calendar --pages eval-inputs/pages --out examples/calendar/evidence/screenshots`.
- The reference journeys in [examples/](../../examples/README.md) record their
  native evidence per project. Their older verifiers (for example
  `examples/aircon/scripts/verify_standalone_cards.py`) are Studio-backed; see
  the compatibility boundary below.
- A packaged OctoSense app runs in App Hub's `card-host`, which exposes the
  same instrument: launch it with `--remote`, inspect with `/snap` and `/d`,
  drive it with `/click`, `/k` and `/t`, capture with `/g` and close with `/gq`.
  See [App Hub's publishing guide](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense-App-Hub/blob/main/docs/PUBLISHING.md).

Keep personal data and real-account captures in ignored storage; publish
fictional fixtures and counts-only receipts. Do not make generic pipeline
documentation depend on a developer-specific absolute home directory.

## Other platforms

The pinned Makepad release compiles its HTTP `--remote` instrument out on
Android. Do not report desktop HTTP probes or Studio captures as Android or
OpenHarmony passes. Device builds and device instrumentation belong to the
runtime repository,
[OctoSense-org/OctoSense-AppCard](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense-AppCard).
Never use OS capture methods (`adb screencap`, `screenrecord`, MediaProjection)
as evidence.

## Existing capture/gate compatibility

The current `flows/image-lib/studio.py` and the flow runner's `capture --launch` stage are still Studio-backed legacy capture adapters. They do **not** switch to direct HTTP because this guide exists. Their saved-round gates expect their existing evidence schema. Preserve prior evidence; do not invent Studio IDs or relabel a direct snapshot as a legacy gate pass.

For new direct-instrument app work, run the shared authoring/compile/service stages explicitly, then the project's owned native verifier:

```sh
bash tools/image-to-appcard-flow.sh run \
  --project "$FLOW_PROJECT" --manifest "$FLOW_PROJECT/image-to-appcard-flow.json" \
  --stages semantic,compile,bundle,service-test
```

Do not select legacy `capture --launch` for a request to test without Studio. Keep direct-instrument results alongside the project's evidence with explicit provenance. Adapting the shared capture/gate implementation to consume these results is separate work; until then, report those legacy stages as unrun. Semantic correctness, native interaction, source-image fidelity, visual review, and browser/platform acceptance remain separate decisions.


## Shared runtime

All flows select the root `native-runtime.lock.json`; its Octoscript-Makepad
release owns the underlying `runtime.json`. Prepare the sibling sources with
`python3 tools/setup-native.py` and verify them with
`python3 tools/setup-native.py --check`. WASM does not apply private framework
patches. Preserve existing edits before updating a checkout. See
[NATIVE-WORKSPACE.md](../../docs/NATIVE-WORKSPACE.md).
